Berestechko Historical novel is a book about one of the greatest tragedies of Ukrainian history - a battle near Berestechko.It was written in 1966-67, it later was written repeatedly at all stages of the following Ukrainian tragedies-both after the defeat of the 60's, and in the hopelessness of the 70s, and in the deceptive traps of the 80s.During this time, from a specific defeat under a specific Berestechko, the theme of this novel grew into a philosophy of defeat in general, into the understanding that "defeat is a science, no victory teaches so", and therefore in the need for victory over defeat.And, rejecting the previous variants as burned out degrees of rockets, today, in an independent Ukraine, at the time it faces the threat of a final defeat, this book has to be written for the author in the need to be published.This is all.This Galich is over the town.The people are free, and now you are - wil.My defeat is called Berestechko.Radziwill comes to Kyiv.I'm no longer me.I was already seized.
